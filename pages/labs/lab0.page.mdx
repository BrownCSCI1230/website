# Lab 0: Setup

## Introduction

The purpose of `lab 0` is twofold: to serve as a **handy** _base_ template for [other lab handouts](/labs), and to teach you some tricks of the trade! You will get to try your hand at doing certain things like `XYZ` and `ABC`, and (hopefully) learn something new in the process. It might also help with your projects (i.e. handouts and algos) :wink:. Inline code can also be **`bold`**.

In the rest of **this 1-2h lab** (NB: actually 5 min), you will:

1. One
2. Two

- Do one thing
- Do another thing

10. One
11. Two

If you know what you're doing, you <i>can</i> write code in your preferred IDE or text editor. Do note, however, that our course uses a standardized environment for grading&mdash;that is to say, we will build and run your projects through Qt Creator. Therefore, you'll probably want to have Qt and Qt Creator, if only to test that your code works as expected!
