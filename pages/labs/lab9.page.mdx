# VBOs/VAOs Lab

Welcome to the world of OpenGL! 

In the last lab, you learned how to construct vertex data for various shapes and put them into a container as continuous floats. 
What you didn’t know is that this representation is actually how OpenGL stores its vertex data as well! 

By the end of this lab, you should be able to 

- Understand the difference between a Vertex Buffer Object and a Vertex Array Object and their individual uses,
- Learn about per vertex attributes and layouts,
- Draw triangle meshes (which you have been creating in the last lab!)


## Intro

Currently, our data is stored in C++ structures on the CPU, but in this lab you will create OpenGL specific objects to both store and describe the data that
can be used for drawing on the GPU. 
 
These objects are: Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO) and Vertex Array Objects (VAO).

  images={[{ src: '/labs/lab10/pipelineWhiteBackground.png', alt: 'TODO' }]}
  figNumber={1}
  targetWidth={'70%'}
  figCaption={'Realtime Pipeline'}
/>

At the moment, you can imagine a VBO to be a dumb container, the same as a C++ 
vector that doesn’t have a clue about the meaning behind the data that is in it. 

The VAO on the other hand acts as a translation manual for the GPU to understand
what data and what format of data is inside a Vertex Buffer Object.

### Using the Khronos Documentation

Before we jump into learning a new API, it always is good practice to explore its documentation!

Most APIs come with some form of documentation on how you can use them. 
OpenGL is no exception, as a matter of fact, OpenGL is made by the Khronos
group (who now is also developing the Vulkan API) and has extensive documentation
on any functions across any version of OpenGL you may use. 

The home page is located [here](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/). 

While our projects are set up to use OpenGL 4.1, the functions we will be using
are within OpenGL ES 3.1 and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) 3.10.

Let’s take a look at a function to see what the docs tell us about it!

:::task
Find the function `glGetError` and open its documentation
:::

Notice the different sections. The first section, **Name**, says the function name along
with a short description of what the function is. This is useful if you want to quickly
browse for a reminder, but often if you are looking at new functions, you will have
to dig deeper.

The second section, **C Specification** says the particular syntax of the function in question.

In cases where a function has input parameters, there will be an intermediate section
titled **Parameters** which gives short descriptions of each input parameter and occasionally
what values they can take on.

The third section, **Description**, gives you much more information about how the function
is used and sometimes information about the parameters in question such as OpenGL error
enums as we see here!

The fourth section, **API Version Support**, tells us in which OpenGL versions this function
can be called. Be aware of this if you are trying to use modern OpenGL functions but any
we cover here will be supported by the stencil’s OpenGL version.

Through this lab and your work in OpenGL, we strongly recommend having the docs open in
another tab to reference, and each function signature will serve as a link to their
relevant page in the docs.

### OpenGL as a State Machine

Instead of defining a bunch of instances of objects and editing them directly,
OpenGL functions as a state machine. This means that you keep track of an OpenGL
context with different settings and conditions which affects every operation you do.
In this way, you will have to change your programming mindset when looking at OpenGL
functions. In a moment, you will encounter the glBindBuffer operation which will be
used to set a specific VBO to be active in the current OpenGL context or state. 
Then in order to edit it, we make calls on the state rather than the object as you
will see.

Because of this unique behavior, it is important to be careful about managing OpenGL’s
state during the execution of your programs. There are two strategies for this:
Assume nothing When writing a function that uses OpenGL, consider that the state could
be anything. Explicitly set the values of the state parameters you depend on.
Default configuration. Decide on a set of reasonable default state values, and set the
state to these values at the start of your application. Anywhere you change one of these state parameters, restore the parameter to its previous value after you’re done rendering a component of the scene.
 
:::task
Search the docs for the `glSetClearColor` function and call at the start of initializeGL
to alter our state and change the background color to anything you like! Run the program
to see what it does.

## Vertex Buffer Objects

Typically, shapes in OpenGL are broken down into a collection of triangles, each of which
is defined by three vertices. So far, we have been processing all of our scene data on
the CPU, but in order to draw using OpenGL, we need to send a list of vertices to the GPU.

To send this data, we need some sort of container or buffer to store it first. In 
OpenGL, this generic container is called a **Vertex Buffer Object**, or **VBO** for short.
The key to VBOs is to remember that they are just mindless containers that store
numbers and nothing more. They have no idea of what they contain or what it will be 
used for. In this lab we will learn about how to create one of these VBOs and use it 
to later draw shapes of our own!

### Creating a Vertex Buffer Object

Let’s take a look at how you would actually create a VBO. The OpenGL function is as follows:

`void glGenBuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint *buffers)`

:::task
Generate a single VBO and store its id in `m_vbo`
:::

### Adding Data

#### Binding a VBO

Congratulations, you have made a VBO! But…it currently holds no data! Let’s fix that. As said before, OpenGL is a state machine, so in order to interact with our created buffer, we need to bind it to the current state. The OpenGL function to do this is:

`void glBindBuffer(GLenum target, GLuint buffer)`

:::task
Bind your previously created VBO
:::

Now our state is all set up to shove our data into our buffer container! 
But before we do this, we actually need some data to put inside. Let’s construct 
an array that represents a triangle.

#### Defining a Triangle

A triangle as said before is defined by 3 vertices. For now, let’s assume that these
vertices are just positions, although in in the last lab you worked with vertex normals
and in part 2 you will learn about more attributes vertices can hold!

As a reminder in OpenGL, the screen is defined as in the image below:

[image]

Take note of the x and y ranges of -1 to 1. As a reminder: in OpenGL,
triangles are defined in a counter clockwise direction. 

:::task
Pick 3 points that would make a nice triangle
:::

#### Putting Data Into a VBO

Now how will we actually put this information into our VBO? Let's take a
look at the function to do so first:

`void glBufferData(GLenum target, GLsizeiptr size, const void * data, GLenum usage)`

Next let’s look at data. The function expects a pointer to an input data array,
but we don’t have that array yet! Let’s use an std::vector to construct our
data container. In OpenGL, rather than separating out values for each individual
vertex, it expects all of them mashed together into one contiguous collection as 
you did in the previous lab, and the VAO you will learn about soon keeps track
of where the attributes are for us!

:::task
Construct an `std::vector` containing your three triangle points in a contiguous segment
:::

Now to pass this into the function, we can use the `data()` method of the `std::vector`
object. This will return a pointer to the first element as needed.

For the size, while we can manually input the size of our data, it is much easier
to let the program calculate that for us. The size of our data is going to be equal to:

<div align="center">(length of data) * (size of type of data stored)</div>

To get the first part is simple using `std::vector` methods. For the second part,
we can take advantage of the `sizeof()` function and pass in the data type stored
in our vector.

:::task
Pass a triangle’s worth of data into your VBO
:::

## Vertex Array Objects

Next, we will tell OpenGL the structure of our data using something called a Vertex Array Object or VAO for short. 

### Vertex Attributes

At the moment, the only data we have cared about is the position of each vertex. 
But as a matter of fact, each vertex can have many more attributes than just its 
position. Consider colors, texture coordinates, or, as you saw in the previous lab, 
normals. These can also be unique to each vertex and it is our job to tell OpenGL what 
attributes we care about. 

When adding multiple attributes, they should appear in the same order and be repeated 
per vertex in our data. Consider the following image which shows a data layout 
containing positions, colors, and texture coordinates:

[image here]

:::task
Add colors of your choosing as RGB values to each vertex and integrate them 
into your previous triangle data vector
:::

### Creating a VAO

Now let’s tell OpenGL that we have this extra attribute by making a VAO! 
The function to do this is:

`void glGenVertexArrays(GLsizei n, GLuint *arrays)`

:::task
Generate a single VAO and store its id in `m_vao`
:::

### Binding a VAO

Next to actually use this VAO, we need to bind it to the state. 
The function to do this is:

`void glBindVertexArray(GLuint array)`

:::task
Bind your VAO
:::

### Utilizing a VAO

Now that the VAO is bound, we can actually use it to let OpenGL know the structure 
of our VBO. For each attribute, we need to do two things: 
1. Let OpenGL know we are identifying an attribute
2. Specify the location of the attribute in the VBO data.

For the first part, we call on the following function:

`void glEnableVertexAttribArray(GLuint index)`

For the second part, we use a more complex function:

`void glVertexAttribPointer(GLuint index, GLint size, GLenum type, GLboolean normalized, GLsizei stride, const void* pointer)`

>Note: These two functions will assume they apply to whichever VBO is currently bound, 
so be careful of your state when using them.

:::task
Add the two attributes of position and color to your VAO
:::

<details> 
    <summary>Does your std::vector look familiar?</summary>

It should! This is the same format of data we worked with in the last lab! 
Without knowing it, you were actually creating VBO/VAO ready data with position 
and normal attributes! Keep that in mind when working on the project!
</details>

## Unbinding Objects

In section 1.2, we discussed common approaches to handling the OpenGL state machine. 
Here, we will implement these ideas by keeping a common default state set. When we 
started, VBO and VAO ids 0 were bound, which means no VBO or VAO was bound. Let’s 
return to that starting condition before we exit the `initializeGL` function.

:::task
Unbind your VBO and VAO
:::

## Drawing in OpenGL

###  Drawing Overview

Great! Now you are ready to draw the triangle you have worked so hard to create. 
To do this, these are the general steps you will want to follow each frame.

1. Clear the screen using `glClear(COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)`
2. For each shader you want to use:
    1. Bind the shader using glUseProgram(GLuint program)
    2. For each VAO you want to draw with the current shader:
        1. Bind the VAO
        2. Draw using glDrawArrays(GLenum mode, GLint first, GLsizei count
        3. Unbind the VAO
    3. Unbind the shader using glUseProgram(0)

>Note: Notice how all operations including a specific shader and VAO are surrounded by a Bind and Unbind call!

For this, you will only be responsible for steps 1 and 2.ii.a through 2.ii.c. 
While these loops are best to keep in mind, oftentimes such as this one you 
will only work with a single shader program and in this case, a single VAO. 
As such, no loops will need to be present in this section of the lab.

:::task
In `PaintGL`, before `glUseProgram`, clear the screen
:::

:::task
In `PaintGL`, after `glUseProgram`, bind our VAO
:::

### The glDrawArrays Call

For the last function, we can first break it down:
void: indicates the function does not return
GLenum mode: indicates the type of primitive to render, for our case, use GL_TRIANGLES
GLint first: indicates the starting index for OpenGL to look in our VBO, and will most usually be 0
GLsizei count: indicates how many vertices to draw

:::task 
At the end of PaintGL, draw our triangle
:::

:::task 
After drawing the triangle, return to default state by unbinding our VAO
:::

## Memory Management

So far, by calling `glGenBuffers` and `glGenVertexArrays`, we have *allocated* space 
to store our data and objects. Unlike smart pointers however, this memory is **not**
automatically freed when it goes out of scope. To do this ourselves, we must call on the
various `glDelete` functions at our disposal.

For now we will use two, `glDeleteBuffers` which applies to VBOs, and `glDeleteVertexArrays'
which applies to VAOs.

:::task
In `finish()`, free your VBO and VAO memory
