# Lab 8: Trimeshes


[GitHub Classroom assignment](https://google.com)


## Intro

One of the fundamental applications of computer graphics is to display three-dimensional scenes. The catch, however, is that screens can only display two-dimensional images. Therefore, we need to convert a three-dimensional scene to something that can be viewed in two dimensions. A common method, which we will use in this lab, is to compose a scene using only triangles, then project those triangles to the screen, drawing each one sequentially.

  <summary>Why do we use triangles?</summary>

Triangles are the only shape with area that is guaranteed to always be in one plane, which helps us avoid a lot of issues, notably with normals, etc. They are also optimized to be rendered really quickly, with most graphics cards have dedicated circuits optimized for this function.

In this lab, you will be writing the portion of this process that pertains to tesselating objects. You will be breaking up these 3D objects into a lot of triangles that, when put together, look as much like the desired 3D shape as possible. Note that curved surfaces can be better approximated using more triangles, but keep in mind that the more triangles we draw the more triangles we compute, and a major motivation behind tessellating objects is to simplify the process of displaying them.

In the Real-Time projects, you will be displaying scenes made up of the following 3D shapes: Cube, Cone, Cylinder, and Sphere. In this lab, you will be implementing two of the four shapes, Cube and Sphere. You will implement the remaining shapes, Cylinder and Cone, in the first Real-Time Project. Throughout the rest of this handout there will be a couple of suggestions that we highly encourage you to consider in your design.

By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Understand that primitives are created from a series of triangles described as a long list of vertices and normals.
2. Learn how to calculate normals given 3 points.
3. Implement a Cube and a Sphere!
