# Lab 7: Terrain

## Introduction

Hello, welcome to the Terrain Lab! We've seen how 2D arrays can store intersection information to be used for lighting computation. Here, we are going to store height information in a 2D array and use it to construct geometry! We will begin by implementing a noise generation function to create mountainous terrain height maps, then we will have a quick exercise in vector operations to add color to our scene. Let's get started!

By the end of this lab you should be able to…

- identify the merits of procedural noise,
- understand how scaling and adding noise create interesting details,
- be able to come up with your own creative uses for procedural noise, and
- work with non-Implicit Geometry and per vertex information.

### Context

The concept of procedural noise in graphics is simply any method that can create randomized data with certain desirable properties (like continuity for example). It is used to make a wide variety of assets, from geometry, to textures.

:::

As you can see from these examples, well constructed noise can be used to create really incredible scenes and images from completely random data!

In this lab we will be primarily focused on using procedural methods to generate 2D textures, specifically a height map, which we will use to generate geometry. There are a wide vareiety of methods to choose from.

### White Noise

:::todo
src="readmeImages/whiteExample.png" width="400"
:::

The most primative form of noise is "white noise" which you may have heard of before. Think of every pixel as having a completely random value completely uncorrelated with the values of its neighbors. However, this ends up looking too random and there is no structure we can make use of.

### Value Noise

:::todo
src="readmeImages/valueExample.png" width="400"
:::

The next form of noise to consider is "value noise." This form of noise is essentially white noise scaled up and interpolated to try to give some smooth gradients and larger structure to the texture (remember the scaling filter?). However, you can see from the results that the final product does not look entirely organic as the gradients are all aligned to the pixel grid.

### Perlin Noise

:::todo
src="readmeImages/perlinExample.png" width="400"
:::

This is where "perlin noise", which is what we will be implementing in this lab, comes in. By defining a grid of _vectors_ instead of values, we can add a lot more interest to the final product as the gradients are no longer aligned along the pixel grid!

## Noise Generator

### Implementation

The method of creating perlin noise is, generally, as follows…

1. define a grid of vectors with randomized direction
2. for a given interest point, find the four closest grid points and compute an offset vector from grid point to the interest point.
3. compute a dot product between each offset and its randomized vector
4. use an interpolation function to combine the 4 dot products into a single value.
5. Repeat for each location you want to evaluate!

Don't worry if you are still confused, this is just a high level overview. We will get into the details in the later tasks!

#### Define Random Vectors

To handle the generation of random vectors, we have provided you with the function `randVec` which takes in integer coordinates and produces a random vector for you to use in your implementation. This function works by combining the input coordinates and then hashing them to get an index in a precomputed list of random vectors. By defining the grid this way, it is both **coherent** (the same input row and column produces the same output vector) and **infinite** in extent.

To give you a quick overview of the stencil you need to worry about for this section, you will mainly be working in

- `getPosition`: uses computePerlin to sample the noise function and generate the output height
- `computePerlin`: computes samples of the noise function using `randVec` and `interpolate`
- `interpolate`: interpolates between input values using the mix parameter

#### Get the Four Closest Grid Indices

:::todo
src="readmeImages/pic1.png" width="800"
:::

Given the floating point coordinates to evaluate, we need to compute the integer indices of the four closest grid points. The simplest way of doing this is casting to an `int` and then incrementing when you need the adjacent indicies. Remember that `computePerlin` takes in floating point coordinates from the Real Plane and that the grid of random vectors is defined for all pairs of **integers**.

::::task

#### Compute Offset Vectors

:::todo

:::

Using the coordinates of the four closest grid points and the input location, compute the four offset vectors from the grid points to the interest point. Do NOT normalize these offset vectors.

::::task

#### Compute Dot Products

:::todo
src="readmeImages/pic3.png" width="800"
:::

We have four offset vectors and can look up the corresponding random grid vector for each using `randVec`.

We now want to compute the dot product between the corresponding offset vectors and random grid vectors. This will yield four floating point values, one for each grid point, that we will combine later on to get the final height.

#### Implement Interpolation

Interpolation is used to extrapolate a continuous function from discrete data points. The simplest method, called linear interpolation, takes the following form:

$$
	y = y_1 + (x - x_1) \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}
$$

- $y$: interpolation value
- $x$: independent variable
- $y_i$, $x_i$: values of the function at a point

This is just the equation of the line passing through the two points! The equation in its current form, while descriptive, is a bit messy for our purposes. If we replace $x$ with a new mix factor $x = m(x_2 - x_1) + x_1$, we can normalize our formula such that the independent variable ranges only from 0 to 1.

$$
\begin{gather}
	y = y_1 + (m(x_2 - x_1) + x_1 - x_1) \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}\\
	y = y_1 + m(x_2 - x_1) \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}\\
	y = y_1 + m(y_2 - y_1)
\end{gather}
$$

So now when $m = 0$ $y = y_1$, when $m = 1$ $y = y_2$, and for values in the middle we get a linear combination! We can represent this visually by graphing the interpolation function.

:::todo

:::

Where the line shows how the interpolation value changes as a function of the independent variable. Upon using this linear interpolation for our terrain generation, we get the following results.

src="readmeImages/image15.png" height="300"
(Value Noise on the Left, Perlin on the Right)
:::

Hmm... it's a start at least.

But the linear nature of the interpolation function leaves the surface way too angular to pass off as reasonable terrain. Ideally we want some way to smooth out the curve. This is where the concept of easing functions comes in!

An easing function has the following properties

- $ease(0) = 0$
- $ease(1) = 1$
- $ease(x) \text{ is continuous}$

You can think of it as remapping the orginial linear slope to whatever curve is desired.

thus our Interpolation formula takes on the new form

$$
	y = y_1 + ease(x)(y_2 - y_1)
$$

The choice of easing function is a creative design decision, not one that can be analytically correct, for example you could choose this weird function if you really wanted

src="readmeImages/image16.png" width="300"
:::

Remember that we want to generate reasonable looking terrain. For that reason, we recommend using cubic easing, given by the formula $ease(x) = 3x^{2}-2x^{3} $, as it yields smooth results.

Feel free to try out your own easing function and show us any cool results! This [website](https://easings.net/) provides a cheat-sheet of common easing functions used in website styling (CSS) but can give you a general sense of the types of things easing functions can do.

#### Combine Dot Products

Now that we have all our data, we need to combine it into one value representing the noise value at this coordinate. This is where we put our interpolation function to work. We have a problem though, we defined our interpolation to work based on two values and one mix parameter, so how are we going to combine 4 different values?

The answer is to perform multiple interpolations and then compose them to get one final value.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/pic4.png" width="800"
:::

Suppose we have the four values A, B, C, and D at their corresponding grid points.

- get G by interpolating between A and B
- get H by interpolating between C and D
- get result by interpolating between G and H

Now that has all been covered, complete the implementation of `generatePerlin` function by writing this four way interpolation!

## Introducing Octaves

Now that we have a simple, bumpy terrain, we are going to add some visual detail by adding multiple copies of noise with different scales. This will replace the smooth unnatural hills with rugged mountains!

:::todo
src="readmeImages/fractalNoiseWireFrame.png" height=500
:::

### Scaling our Perlin Noise

The first thing to understand is how to scale the noise in the first place. Remember how we are generating the height in the first place, a call to (name of function here) with x and y used directly.

::::task
Modify just the inputs to `computePerlin` and generate noise with a different scale.
::::

### What are Octaves

:::todo
src="readmeImages/Octave Noise Example.png" style="width: 100%;"
:::

Now that we know how to scale the noise, the question is how much? Well we could pick any arbitrary amount to be honest. However, one technique which gives natural looking results is to increase the frequency by powers of two. By doubling the frequency we get the next "octave" of the noise (to people with some knowledge of music this may be familiar).

But we have to be careful when doing this. If we just directly add the higher frequency noise without changing it, the higher frequencies will overpower the lower frequency information. To protect against this, as we double the frequency of the noise, we halve the amplitude. This keeps a hierarchy to the noise that gives a really good effect.

::::task
In the (compute height function) use multiple calls to the generate noise function to add at least 4 different noise octaves to the scene each with the correct amplitude and frequency to generate rugged terrain!
::::

## Hit the Slopes

Now that the height map has been specified, we have some mountainous terrain but there is no color variation leading to a somewhat bland scene. To add some visual interest, we are going to introduce a per-vertex color based on the slope of the surrounding terrain. The end goal will be gray stone-line mountain slopes with white snow covering flat areas and peaks.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/normalsComputerd.png" style="width: 45%;"
src="readmeImages/coloredTerrain.png" style="width: 45%;"
:::

::::task
To start off switch `m_wireshade` to false in the constructor.
::::

Your terrain should now appear solid white. This is because the normals are being set to (0,0,1) in `getNormal` as a placeholder. Let's fix that!

### Getting the Normal

We are now faced with the problem of computing the normal for any given vertex. As the geometry is procedurally generated, we cannot use the same formulaic approach as we did for implicit geometry. Instead we need a dynamic algorithm for computing the normals given arbitary geometry. As we are looking for a mountain-like appearance, a simple, smooth surface should suffice as the height map itself describes the roughness. With this in mind, a simple local average should suffice to smooth out the surface.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/Normals1.png" style="width: 40%;"
:::

Start by considering a vertex $V$ surrounded by its eight neighbors $n_0$ through $n_7$.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/Normals2.png" style="width: 40%;"
:::

Begin by grouping the vertices in triangles such that all triangles have a corner in $V$,
this creates triangles of the following form $(V, n_i, n_{i+1})$.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/Normals3.png" style="width: 40%;"
:::

To compute the normal for triangle $(V, n_i, n_{i+1})$, Take the cross product (math equation here) and then normalize the result.

:::todo
src="readmeImages/Normals4.png" style="width: 40%;"
:::

Now that we have the normals for each triangle, sum and normalize to find the final normal for $V$.

::::task
In the `getNormal` function use getPosition and compute the normal for the specified vertex.
::::

### Setting the Color

Now that we have the normal, we need to use this slope information to make vertical sections gray and horizontal sections white.

To do this we are going to use our old friend, Interpolation! The first step is to get the mix factor. To do this take a dot product with the normal and a vector pointing directly up. The result will range from 1.0 when the slope is exactly horizontal to 0.0 when the slope is exactly vertical. We then use this value to interpolate between gray and white!
